                Of all tombs in the Valley of Kings, King Tutankhamun is the Most Important

                King Tutankhamun is said to be one of the most important pharaohs who ever lived. He became king while
                still
                a child after his father's death

                He died after an accident and was buried with many precious treasures. Howard Carter discovered his
                grave in
                1922. The period of his rule was an ancient period and a period of prosperity

                All of the treasure in his tomb can now be viewed at the Egyptian Museum on a one-day trip to Cairo

                It was an ancient belief that kings were buried with their own gold, so the Valley of the Kings was
                protected from thieves and guarded over it because it includes many tombs, some of which have been
                discovered and more are still being explored.

                it
                through your trips with Mr Egypt. Since the tombs belong to members of the royal family, their graves
                must look beautiful. Other than decorating them with valuables, they also had drawings and hieroglyphs
                on
                the walls. Discover it with Mr Egypt.
