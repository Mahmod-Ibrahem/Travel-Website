                Visit Karnak Temple, one of the biggest temple complexes in the world, and go on a trip through the
                ages.
                This enormous outdoor museum is a maze of stately pylons, tall columns, and finely carved reliefs
                honoring
                the three Theban gods: Mut, Khonsu, and Amun. Karnak's magnificence illustrates the growth of Egyptian
                religious architecture over the ages and depicts the riches and power of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

                See Luxor Temple, a magnificent example of ancient Egyptian architecture tucked away in the center of
                contemporary Luxor, to go back in time. Throughout Egypt's history, this temple, which was devoted to
                the
                deity Amun-Ra, functioned as the center of religious events and regal rituals. Admire the elaborately
                painted walls featuring images of pharaonic victories and heavenly gifts, walk down the avenue of
                sphinxes,
                and marvel at the enormous sculptures of Ramses II

                Experience the Avenue of Sphinxes, an ancient processional path that formerly linked Luxor Temple with
                Karnak Temple. This magnificent walkway, which was more than three kilometers long and adorned with
                hundreds
                of sphinx sculptures, represented the gods' heavenly protection and served as a hallowed route for
                religious
                processions and ceremonial rites. The goal of the current restoration work is to revitalize this ancient
                boulevard and provide tourists with a window into Egypt's history.
