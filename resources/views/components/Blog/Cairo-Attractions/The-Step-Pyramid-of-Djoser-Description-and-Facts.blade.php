            <p class="destination_p">
                The Pyramid of Djoser, located in Saqqara, near Cairo, holds the distinction of being the first pyramid
                ever
                built.
                This Cairo Attraction is a pioneer in pyramid architecture, marking the shift from traditional mastabas
                to
                the grandeur of pyramids that would define ancient Egypt.

                A 4,700-year-old step pyramid, built in the 27th century BC. For the third dynasty of Pharaoh Djoser, it
                is
                considered the oldest stone structure in the country, which is characterized by its wonderful attractive
                designs and massive gradients that show its ancient Egyptian greatness in construction.A pyramid is a
                three-dimensional shape. A pyramid has a polygonal base and flat triangular faces, which join at a
                common
                point called the apex. A pyramid is formed by connecting the bases to an apex. Each edge of the base is
                connected to the apex, and forms the triangular face, called the lateral face. With Egypt Classic Tour

            <header class="destination_header "> The Vision of Imhotep</header>
            <p class="destination_p">
                Cairo Day Tours guide you through the legacy of Imhotep, the visionary architect behind the Pyramid of
                Djoser. Imhotep's revolutionary design transformed burial structures, creating a step pyramid that
                showcased
                architectural ingenuity and set the stage for future pyramid constructions.

                The walls were often covered with sculptures and paintings, which we distinguish with their picturesque
                colors, which dazzle everyone who sees them, and they show the superiority of the ancient Egyptian in
                colors
                and drawings.Today the pyramids stand as a reminder of ancient Egypt's glorification of life after
                death,
                and in fact, the pyramids were built as monuments to house the tombs of the pharaohs. Death was seen as
                just
                the beginning of a journey to the other world. And these were their ancient beliefs, so many tombs were
                built for kings to glorify them and complete their lives . It is one of the pyramids in Cairo, as it is
                the
                oldest pyramid built in Egypt. You can learn about it during Egypt travel packages.
